# Project: Datascience Blog post
In the scope of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program, the first project is related to data analysis of data set from Airbnb, which should be presented in form of a blog post.

# Motivation
Airbnb is a property rental platform which accelerated tourism and travel (as well as nomad working) tremendously. As part of Data Science Nanodegree project from Udacity, I analyzed dataset from Seattle Airbnb Dataset from 2017 available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

## Business Questions Considered

The questions I wanted to study and engage community to comment and discuss are following:
- What are the busiest periods in Seattle and in which areas?
- What are the average prices for rentals on Airbnb and - what are the most expensive areas?
- Price prediction with scikit-learn.

# Files
Main files are Jupyter notebook in the root of repository and data files in folder [data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017](./data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017). 

Datafiles are:
- [calendar.csv](./data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017/calendar.csv) - availability of listings
- [listings.csv](./data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017/listings.csv) - detailed description of listings
- [neighbourhoods.csv](./data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017/neighbourhoods.csv) - data about neighbourhoods in Seattle
- [neighbourhoods.geojson](./data/kaggle_seattle_airbnb_2017/neighbourhoods.geojson) - geographic data about neighbourhoods

# Summary of results
The sumarry of analysis and results are described and published in [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikoladjor/udacity-data-science-nanodegree-analysis-of-seattle-airbnb-dataset-3c3d31b07d76) article.
